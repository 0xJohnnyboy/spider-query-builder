# Contributing

If you're interested in contributing, there's not much going on.

Feel free to make a PR with whatever you think would improve this lib, as long as it's clearly described.
Please make [atomic commits](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/atomic-git-commits/). Concerning commit message formatting, I try to follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines.

I won't accept untested changes. I use Mocha and Chai, you will find examples in the `test` directory.
